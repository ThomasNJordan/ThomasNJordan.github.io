# Customize

Here we will give you some tips on how to customize the website. One important thing to note is that **ALL** the changes you make should be done on the **main** branch of your repository. The `gh-pages` branch is automatically overwritten every time you make a change to the main branch.

## Project structure

The project is structured as follows, focusing on the main components that you will need to modify:

```txt
.
├── 📂 assets/: contains the assets that are displayed in the website
│   └── 📂 json/
│       └── 📄 resume.json: CV in JSON format (https://jsonresume.org/)
├── 📄 _config.yml: the configuration file of the template
├── 📂 _data/: contains some of the data used in the template
│   ├── 📄 cv.yml: CV in YAML format, used when assets/json/resume.json is not found
│   └── 📄 repositories.yml: users and repositories info in YAML format
├── 📂 _layouts/: contains the layouts to choose from in the frontmatter of the Markdown files
├── 📂 _pages/: contains the pages of the website
|   └── 📄 404.md: 404 page (page not found)
├── 📂 _posts/: contains the blog posts
├── 📂 _projects/: contains the projects
└── 📂 _sass/: contains the SASS files that define the style of the website
    ├── 📄 _base.scss: base style of the website
