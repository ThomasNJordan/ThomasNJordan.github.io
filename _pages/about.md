Hello! I'm Thomas Jordan. I'm a Junior Computer Science major and Information Security and Policy minor. I'm an incoming Masters student at Chapman for the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering program. I have experience working in the education and financial sector. 

My technical proficiency spans a wide range of tools and frameworks. I am well-versed in the MITRE ATT&CK and CIS 18 frameworks, risk management, and exploitation techniques for Windows environments. I am proficient in using penetration testing tools, conducting PCAP analysis, and deploying and configuring EDR/IDR solutions. My scripting skills in Bash, PowerShell, and Python, along with my knowledge of SIEM systems like Microsoft Defender, Splunk, and Elastic Stack, enable me to effectively monitor and secure networks, as well as validate and test security control configurations.

I have practical experience from internships at GCM Grosvenor and Chapman University, where I collaborated across teams to document, investigate, and remediate security incidents, and effectively detected and stopped phishing attempts. As a research assistant, I designed machine learning models using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Jupyter to predict the remaining useful life of turbojet engine components, showcasing my ability to apply advanced analytical techniques, machine learning, and math to real-world problems. 

My commitment to continuous learning and development is demonstrated through my participation in numerous Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, where I am ranked within the top 900 players on Hack The Box. I have honed my skills in Linux, Windows, networking, and various programming languages. I have practiced penetration testing techniques, attacking web application, privelege escolation, and establishing footholds in all kinds of enviorments. I have also worked on projects such as developing custom ransomware to better understand why ransomware authros make certain design choices, as well as to better understand the structure of malware when reverse engineering.

I hold the CompTIA Security+ certification and I am currently studying for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. I am passionate about leveraging my skills and experience to help organizations protect their digital assets and enhance their security posture, as well as protecting the privacy of their customers. I am willing to relocate and eager to take on new challenges.
