## About
Starting from knowing nothing about malware development, windows internals, or creating red team infrastructure; I ended up creating a piece of malware that can be used as a RAT, Ransomware, and even as a botnet. Each module covers a topic, and contains documented code snippets intended to help people who want a hands-on learning experience. 

## List of Modules

- 02: Process Injection
- 03: DLL Injection/Hijacking
- 04: Reflective DLL Injection
- 05: Anti-sandboxing
- 06: Keylogger
- 07: Basic Anti-Debugging
- 08: Self-Deleting Malware
- 09: NTAPI Injection
- 10: Direct Syscalls
- 11: Indirect Syscalls

## Reflection
This was a difficult project that I am very proud of. I started with no background knowledge, and built up through hands-on learning.
