## General Info
A collection of scripts, tools, and other resources I used while working through CryptoHack.org. All sciprts are written in Python 3

## Catagories
* AES
* RSA
* Python Syntax and Data Conversion
* Block Ciphers
* Math and Number Theory
* Reading and PDFs
* Real World Implemnetations of each technology.

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using git:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/stand4rd/CryptoHack.git
```

## Prerequisites
```
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-dev git libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pwntools
$ python3 -m pip install pyCryptoDome && pythohn3 -m pip install z3-solver
```

## Reflection
Cryptohack is a great website for learning more about cryptography, and it was a great opprotunity to expand my math background and get more hands-on experience with modern cryptography, and how it interacts with modern computing systems.
